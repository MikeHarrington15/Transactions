# Transactions

In order to run this code on your computer, you will need to download python3 onto your computer. After you have downloaded python3, save the files transactions.csv and points.py into a folder of your choice. Then, go to your Terminal (if you are on Mac), or equivalent, and go to the repository that you have previously saved your files. To move through folders, use the ls and cd commands. When you are in the proper folder where transactions.csv and points.py are located, run the command 'python3 points.py [# points you would like to spend] transactions.csv'.
